# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied to the `main` branch on a rolling basis. Release tags inherit the latest hardening patches when published.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please disclose vulnerabilities privately by emailing security@paypay.example. Provide a detailed description, steps to reproduce, and any proof-of-concept exploits. We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a remediation plan within 5 business days.

PGP-encrypted reports are welcome. Our public key is available upon request.

## Disclosure Process

1. We validate and prioritize the report.
2. A fix is developed and reviewed under embargo.
3. Coordinated disclosure happens once mitigations are available. Credit is attributed with permission.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and are committed to transparent communication.
